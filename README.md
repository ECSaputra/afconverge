# AFconverge

AFconverge (alignment-free converge) is a comparative genomics method that predicts the regulatory adaptations underlying the evolution of convergent phenotypes. Given a set of "comparable" (not necessarily alignable) orthologous sequences of regulatory non-coding elements, AFconverge computes phenotypic convergence signals at individual transcription factor (TF) motif level, identifying motif gains and losses associated with the phenotype.


## Installation and dependencies

Running AFconverge requires the installation of both Python and R.
